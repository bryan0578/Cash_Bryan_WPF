//Should I go to the store?

//This program will tell me if I need to go to the store to buy eggs milk or bread, and tell me which of these items I
//I will need to buy at the store

//Prompt user to enter the amount of milk left in their container of milk by percent amount, prompt user to enter the
//amount of eggs left in their container, and prompt user to answer yes or no to the question "Is there any bread?"

    "enter 100 if your container is half full enter 50, if your container is a quarter full enter 25.")

var answer = prompt("Is there any bread? Enter yes or no.")

//if the user has bread, greater than or equal to half of a container of milk, and greater than or equal to 6 eggs

if(answer == "yes" && milk >= 50 && eggs >= 6){

    //The user does not need to go to the store

    alert("I do not need to go to the store")

    console.log("I do not need to go to the store")

    // if the user has bread and less than half of a container of milk and more than or equal to 6 eggs
