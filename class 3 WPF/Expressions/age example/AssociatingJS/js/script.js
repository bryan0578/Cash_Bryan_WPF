//Dogs age 7 times faster than humans so a dog that is 1 year old in human years is 7 years old in “dog years.”
//Calculate how old Sparky the pit bull is in dog years based on his actual age.

var sparkysAge = 7;

const DOGYEARS = 7;

//multiply SparkysAge and dogAge and assign variable dogYears

var dogAge = sparkysAge * DOGYEARS

//print out the sparkys age in dog years

console.log("Sparky is " + sparkysAge + " human years old which is " + dogAge + " in dog years!");



//A bunch of students are having a party and somebody ordered pizza. Create an expression that calculates how much pizza
//each party-goer will get at the party.  (Assume all pizzas have the same number of slices and that the person dividing
//the pizza is really precise, so this can be a decimal, like 3.52 slices, etc.)

var students = 20;
var pizza = 10;
const SLICES = 8;

//Multiply pizza and slices and then divide by students

var slicePerStudent = pizza * SLICES / students;

//Print variable slicePerStudent

console.log("Each person ate " + slicePerStudent + " slices of pizza at the party.");
