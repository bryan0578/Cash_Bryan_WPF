__WPF__ Web Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains some of the very first code I have ever written learning Web Programming Fundamentals. All of the code is JavaScript that runs in an HTML document. This repository also contains a flow chart on the process of shaving as wells as a problem solving activity document that I completed for course. We were given problems and told to solve them in as many ways as possible.

## Test my code

There are multiple folders each with thier own HTML file along with an external JavaScript file.
To run each code 

1. Download all the files in the repository
2. Open the file you wish to test
3. Click on the index.html file
