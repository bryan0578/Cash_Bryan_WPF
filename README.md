__WPF__ Web Programming Fundamentals

This repository contains some of the very first code I have ever written learning Web Programming Fundamentals. All of the code is JavaScript that runs in an HTML document. This repository also contains a flow chart on the process of shaving as wells as a problem solving activity document that I completed for course. We were given problems and told to solve them in as many ways as possible.

> Fun Fun Fun, I recently updated most of the code to write to an HTML document using document.write instead of console.log. So when you load each page you will see a long line of text where all of the JavaScript has run and wrote it in the HTML document. When you look at the code in the JavaScript File and the line of text on the screen it should all make sense. Some of the programs use JavaScript alerts in the browser. This was used both to handle imput as well as make the code easier to  understand. If you decide to check out my code be aware there are a lot of alerts.

## Test my code

There are multiple folders each with thier own HTML file along with an external JavaScript file.
To run each code:

1. Download all the files in the repository
2. Open the file you wish to test
3. Click on the index.html file
